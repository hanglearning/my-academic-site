abstract: Accurate real-time traffic flow prediction can be leveraged to relieve
  traffic congestion and associated negative impacts. The existing centralized
  deep learning methodologies have demonstrated high prediction accuracy, but
  suffer from privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of transportation
  data. Moreover, the emerging literature on traffic prediction by distributed
  learning approaches, including federated learning, primarily focuses on
  offline learning. This paper proposes BFRT, a blockchained federated learning
  architecture for online traffic flow prediction using real-time data and edge
  computing. The proposed approach provides privacy for the underlying data,
  while enabling decentralized model training in real-time at the Internet of
  Vehicles edge. We federate GRU and LSTM models and conduct extensive
  experiments with dynamically collected arterial traffic data shards. We
  prototype the proposed permissioned blockchain network on Hyperledger Fabric
  and perform extensive tests using virtual machines to simulate the edge nodes.
  Experimental results outperform the centralized models, highlighting the
  feasibility of our approach for facilitating privacy-preserving and
  decentralized real-time traffic flow prediction.
