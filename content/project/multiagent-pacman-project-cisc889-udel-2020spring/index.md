This is our final project for CISC889 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) at the University of Delaware. Base on the video game Mr. Pac-Man framework from CS188 UCB, we designed a strategy to apply multiple Pacman agents to eat pellets in the maze. To get a higher score, Pacman should eat all pellets as quickly as possible while avoid being eaten by the ghosts.
