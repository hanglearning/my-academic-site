I am a first-year M.S. transferred Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Delaware. My academic advisor is [Prof. Chien-Chung Shen](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cshen/). My research interests span distributed systems and artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on using the distributed ledger technology (blockchain) to facilitate robust federated learning in various applications. My most recent work *[Robust Blockchained Federated Learning with Model Validation and Proof-of-Stake Inspired Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03300)* is published at *[Workshop 25 Towards Robust, Secure and Efficient Machine Learning of AAAI-21](http://federated-learning.org/rseml2021/)*. I gave a comprehensive talk about this work in the following video (84mins).

I am now actively looking for an internship, either remote or based in America, for summer 2021. I am currently learning Hyperledger Fabric and Golang, and expect myself to apply them to business solutions. I would appreciate it if you could [send me an email](mailto:hangforjobs@gmail.com) if there are suitable positions related to my research field.
